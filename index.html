            <h4>The Eiffel Tower</h4>
            <p>
                Known as a symbol of love, the Eiffel Tower is a famous monument recognized worldwide. Visiting the Eiffel Tower was everything I had imagined. 
                My visit was significant because the Summer 2024 Olympics were taking place in Paris, and preparations were in progress. 
                The Olympic logo was displayed on the Eiffel Tower.
                
                When I visited the Eiffel Tower, I had to buy a ticket online, and the prices varied depending on the floor. 
                During my visit, I only had access to the first floor. Nevertheless, it was such a wonderful visit. 
                Taking pictures with family and admiring the detail and architecture of the Eiffel Tower amazed me. 
                Another wonderful thing we caught during our trip was the Eiffel Tower at night. 
                Locals told us there would be a light show every night, and we were in awe when we saw the lights on the Eiffel Tower. 
                The night's show made me realize how wonderful the Eiffel Tower was.

            <h4>The Palace of Versailles</h4>
            <p>
                The Palace of Versailles truly takes you back in time through its architects and design.
                When I visited The Palace of Versailles, I was shocked by its beauty. 
                Every detail and structure made me feel like a visit to the past. In pictures, it looked tiny, 
                but the building was tall and massive in person. While looking around the palace, we managed to visit the Louvre Pyramid. 
                My visit to the Palace of Versailles was brief due to the limited time and the museum's closing hours. However, visiting both of these 
                famous monuments was something I will never forget.

            <h4>Disneyland Paris</h4>
            <p>
                My visit to Disneyland Paris was magical. It was my final journey in Paris, and we stayed in one of the hotels located near the park. 
                A side note: bring your shampoo, conditioner and soap. The hotels in Paris don't carry any. When I entered the park, I was amazed by the structures, 
                the small town, and the castle. The structures and the attractions were my favourite rides. I was in shock and questioned how they made these ride attractions. 
                Some of my favourite rides were the Pirates Caribbean attraction ride, Small World Ride, Phantom Manor, and Peter Pan's Flight were my top favourite rides. 
                These rides were not as thrilling or aggressive as others, but they were more enjoyable to watch. Another thing I like about this place is the parades. 
                There were certain times during my visit when there would be a parade, and I managed to attend them all. Lastly, my most memorable and favourite moment visiting 
                Paris was the Disney Illuminations at night. I teared up during that show for the first time, and it was beautiful, with the fireworks, lights, illuminations, and 
                song choices. Words could not describe how that moment felt. That show made me feel like a child again, recalling when I watched all the Disney films. Disneyland was 
                my favourite place during my visit to Paris.
